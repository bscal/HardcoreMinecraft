# HardcoreMinecraft
A Minecraft plugin made using Paper API and Spigotlib

Currently built for minecraft Paper/Spigot 1.16.1

Uses latest version of [SpigotLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/spigotlib.5925/). Must be in server's plugins folder.

I developed it with a slighty modified build of SpigotLib. The ONLY difference is I include Paper-1.16.1 and another dependencies I couldnt find. 
The code changes only include import and import related naming changes. So it should and I have tested work with base SpigotLib.

### Buidling
Use `mvn clean install`

You will need the SpigotLib.jar in the project folder under ./lib/SpigotLib.jar.
